## Welcome to mimik Edge Cloud Computing GitHub page:


#### edgeSDK
It is an SDK for edge cloud computing with a collection of APIs that enable developers to turn computing devices (mobiles, tablets, PCs, wearables, IoT devices, etc.) into edge cloud servers and network them together.mimik edgeSDK provides discovery, connection and communication across edge nodes and a runtime environment for microservices.

mimik edgeSDK is availble for variety of platfroms. To learn more,  click on the following link:

- Android
- [iOS](https://github.com/mimikgit/edgeSDK-iOS)
- Linux - Ubuntu
- mac OS X
- Windows 10
- Linux - Debian
- Linux - Raspbian
- Tizen

mimik edgeSDK provide a JavaScript severless programming API for developers to develop and deploy their own microservices. According to the industry most acknowledged definition, Microservice(s) is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services. [see JS Serverless programming API](https://github.com/mimikgit/edgeMicroservices/wiki/Editing-How-to-use-mimik-serverless-JavaScript-programming-API)

The following are some microservices that we developed for own purpose and could be used as an example for other developers learning how to use the proposed API.

#### mSuperdrive microservice: 
mSuperdrive microservice, provides API for media distribution use cases. By useing mSuperdrive we can permanently share any type of file or content on any node (edge or cloud node) with any other nodes on any type of network (Wi-Fi, LTE or 3G). You can also use this mocroservice to share file or any content with your friends who are registered with mimik as a user. mSuperdrive is using other microservices (e.g. BmBeam and mdrive) to provide some specific services. 

#### mDrive microservice: 
mDrive microservice abstracts access to storage capability available on any edge node(s) and provides distributed file management via a popular API. The API of mDrivecould be compared with Google drive, DropBox, iCloud or some other cloud based "drive" products with this big diffrence that you can this microservice on the edge nodes and also teh cloud nodes.

#### mBeam microservice: 
mBeams contents from a node to a node and/or to service(s), peer-to-peer, one-to-one or one-to-many
