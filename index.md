### JavaScript Serverless Programming API 

mimik edgeSDK provides a JavaScript programming API for developers to develop and deploy their microservices. According to the industry most acknowledged definition, Microservice(s) is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services. [see JS Serverless programming API](https://github.com/mimikgit/mimik-edge-microservices/wiki/Editing-How-to-use-mimik-serverless-JavaScript-programming-API)

The following are some microservices that we developed for designated purposes and could be used as an example by other developers to learn how to use the proposed API.

### Microservices


#### mSuperdrive microservice: 
mSuperdrive microservice, provides API for media distribution use cases. By using mSuperdrive we can permanently share any type of file or content on any node (edge or cloud node) with any other nodes on any type of network (Wi-Fi, LTE or 3G). 
We can also use this microservice to share content with friends who are registered with mimik as an user. mSuperdrive is using other microservices (e.g. mBeam and mDrive) to provide designated services.

#### mDrive microservice: 
mDrive microservice abstracts access to storage capability available on any edge node(s) and provides distributed file management via a popular API. The API of mDrive could be compared with Google drive, Drobox, iCloud or some other cloud based "drive" services with this big difference that you can deploy and use this microservice on any capable edge node or even a cloud node.

#### mBeam microservice: 
mBeam shares the link of a content or file existing on an edge node with another edge node and/or service.
