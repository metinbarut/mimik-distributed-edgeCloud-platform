## Welcome to mimik microservices GitHub page:

mimik edgeSDK provide a JavaScript severless programming API for developers to develop and deploy their own microservices. According to the industry most acknowledged definition, Microservice(s) is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services.

The following are some microservices that we developed for own purpose and could be used as an example for other developers learning how to use the proposed API.

### mSuperdrive microservice: 

### mDrive microservice: 
abstracts access to storage available on edge nodes and provides distributed file management via a popular API.

### mBeam microservice: 
beams content from a node to node(s) and/or to service(s), peer-to-peer, one-to-one or one-to-many
